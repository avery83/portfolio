# My Portfolio Website

## About my site
I wanted to create a personal website to showcase my skillset and have somewhere to post my resume and show my projects.
I built a single page website using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery. I used Bootstrap and AngularJS as frameworks.

## Things I still need to do
I need to start putting my school projects onto the site.
